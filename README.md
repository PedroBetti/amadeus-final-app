# amadeus-final-app

This is the main code for our backend server. It includes the python flask script, the chatterbot AI which we dont we use anymore,
all the required code to make it work. If you wanna run this I would sujest you read up on gunterbox, Flask, and the other requirements
and run it on your local machine thorugth a python env.
